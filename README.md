- Hi, I’m @soupghost :)
- Any pronouns
- I’m interested in writing, drawing, coding, the album Hawaii: Part II (which turned nine on 12/12/21!).
- I'm currently learning javascript & guitar!
- I'm always open to collaborate, but I'm still learning! So I wouldn't recommend collaborating just yet, lol.
- You can reach me through my discord, soupghost#1747 for fastest reponses. You can also gmail me at Kingjoseph6563@gmail.com
- alert("hi, you're cool :D");
